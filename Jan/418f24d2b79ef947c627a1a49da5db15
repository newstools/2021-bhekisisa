Publication title:  Towards a people’s vaccine campaign – a call to action Author(s): C19 People’s Coalition Publication date: 12 January 2021 The C19 People’s Coalition is a civil society organisation set up in March 2020 in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Its members include various structures including trade unions and nonprofit organisations. The coalition aims to make sure South Africa’s COVID-19 response is “rooted in social justice” and prioritises those who are most vulnerable. Their call to action encourages South Africans to get on board to ensure inoculation against the virus happens in an equitable way. The people of South Africa must play an active role in this project, the Coalition argues, to ward against government corruption, cronyism, and the profiteering motives of the private sector.
