You see their faces on your screens explaining the latest in pandemic breaking news. You read their names on story bylines picking apart the science and the politics behind the changing policies. You hear their voices on your radio airwaves explaining what the latest case numbers mean for you and your family. Now you get an inside look at the realities of South Africa’s journalists bringing you the latest in COVID news. Our fifth #BhekisisaWebinar, hosted Tuesday 22 June, brought together journalists and editors from across South Africa’s leading media houses. The panel of five, led in conversation by Bhekisisa’s very own Mia Malan, discussed the realities of reporting from the frontlines, how the pandemic has affected the business of news, and how covering COVID has illuminated the politics behind the science.
