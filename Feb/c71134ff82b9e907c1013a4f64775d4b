Presentation title: HIV prevention 2021 – Where are we now and where are we going? Speakers: Anthony Fauci (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases), Winnie Byanyima (The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS) Publication date: 27 January 2021 In this opening session for the fourth HIV Research for Prevention (HIVR4P) conference, the speakers set the stage and provide an overview of some of the highlights in HIV prevention along with recent breakthroughs in the field. In the past 40 years, scientists and activists have grappled with many challenges around combatting the HIV pandemic — from combating HIV denialism to finding a vaccine for a complex virus. While the recent emergence of the new COVID-19 pandemic brings with it new challenges for HIV prevention, it also creates an opportunity to share knowledge and collaborate on fighting both outbreaks together.
